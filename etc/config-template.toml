[storage]
## The storage format version in storage engine. Valid values: 1, 2.
## format_version = 2

## If there are multiple SSD disks on the machine,
## specify the path list on `storage.main.dir` can improve TiFlash performance.

## If there are multiple disks with different IO metrics (e.g. one SSD and some HDDs)
## on the machine, 
## set `storage.latest.dir` to store the latest data on SSD (disks with higher IOPS metrics)
## set `storage.main.dir` to store the main data on HDD (disks with lower IOPS metrics)
## can improve TiFlash performance.

[storage.main]
## The list of directories to store the main data. More than 90% of the total data is stored in
## the directory list.
# dir = [ "/tidb-data/tiflash-9000" ]
## or
# dir = [ "/ssd0/tidb-data/tiflash", "/ssd1/tidb-data/tiflash" ]
## The maximum storage capacity of each directory in storage.main.dir.
## If it is not set, or is set to multiple 0, the actual disk (the disk where the directory is located) capacity is used.
## Note that human-readable numbers such as "10GB" are not supported yet.
## Numbers are specified in bytes.
## The size of the capacity list should be the same with the dir size.
## For example:
# capacity = [ 10737418240, 10737418240 ]

[storage.latest]
## The list of directories to store the latest data. About 10% of the total data is stored in
## the directory list. The directories (or directory) listed here require higher IOPS
## metrics than those in storage.main.dir.
## If it is not set (by default), the values of storage.main.dir are used.
# dir = [ ]
## The maximum storage capacity of each directory in storage.latest.dir.
## If it is not set, or is set to multiple 0, the actual disk (the disk where the directory is located) capacity is used.
# capacity = [ 10737418240, 10737418240 ]
## The maximum storage capacity of each directory in storage.main.dir.

# capacity = [ 10737418240, 10737418240 ]

[storage.raft]
## The path(s) to store Raft data.
## If not set, it will be the paths in `storage.latest.dir` appended with "/kvstore".
# dir = [ ]

[storage.io_rate_limit]
## This configuration item determines whether to limit the I/O traffic, which is disabled by default. This traffic limit in TiFlash is suitable for cloud storage that has the disk bandwidth of a small and specific size.
## The total I/O bandwidth for disk reads and writes. The unit is bytes and the default value is 0, which means the I/O traffic is not limited by default.
# max_bytes_per_sec = 0
## max_read_bytes_per_sec and max_write_bytes_per_sec have similar meanings to max_bytes_per_sec. max_read_bytes_per_sec means the total I/O bandwidth for disk reads, and max_write_bytes_per_sec means the total I/O bandwidth for disk writes.
## These configuration items limit I/O bandwidth for disk reads and writes separately. You can use them for cloud storage that calculates the limit of I/O bandwidth for disk reads and writes separately, such as the Persistent Disk provided by Google Cloud Platform.
## When the value of max_bytes_per_sec is not 0, max_bytes_per_sec is prioritized.
# max_read_bytes_per_sec = 0
# max_write_bytes_per_sec = 0

## The following parameters control the bandwidth weights assigned to different I/O traffic types. Generally, you do not need to adjust these parameters.
## TiFlash internally divides I/O requests into four types: foreground writes, background writes, foreground reads, background reads.
## When the I/O traffic limit is initialized, TiFlash assigns the bandwidth according to the following weight ratio.
## The following  default configurations indicate that each type of traffic gets a weight of 25% (25 / (25 + 25 + 25 + 25) = 25%).
## If the weight is configured to 0, the corresponding I/O traffic is not limited.
# foreground_write_weight = 25
# background_write_weight = 25
# foreground_read_weight = 25
# background_read_weight = 25
## TiFlash supports automatically tuning the traffic limit for different I/O types according to the current I/O load. Sometimes, the tuned bandwidth might exceed the weight ratio set above.
## auto_tune_sec indicates the interval of automatic tuning. The unit is seconds. If the value of auto_tune_sec is 0, the automatic tuning is disabled.
# auto_tune_sec = 5
