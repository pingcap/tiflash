## Performance Questions

- What version of TiFlash are you using?

- What's the observed and your expected performance respectively?

- Have you compared TiFlash with other databases? If yes, what's their difference?

- For a general performance question, e.g. the benchmark result you got by yourself is not expected, please provide the following information:
    - Your cluster's topology architecture.
    - A simple description of you workload.
    - The metrics PDF generated from Grafana monitor. Remember to set the time range to the performance issue duration.
