    // back even after a crash-recovery. In this recovery mode, RocksDB guarantees
    // this as long as `WritableFile::Append()` writes are durable. In case the
    // user needs the guarantee in more situations (e.g., when
    // `WritableFile::Append()` writes to page cache, but the user desires this
    // guarantee in face of power-loss crash-recovery), RocksDB offers various
    // mechanisms to additionally invoke `WritableFile::Sync()` in order to
    // strengthen the guarantee.

    // `kPointInTimeRecovery` will stop recovery just before the corruption since
    // that is a valid point-in-time to which to recover.
