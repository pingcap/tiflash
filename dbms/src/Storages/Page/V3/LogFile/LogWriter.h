/**
 * Writer is a general purpose log stream writer. It provides an append-only
 * abstraction for writing data. The details of the how the data is written is
 * handled by the WriteableFile sub-class implementation.
 *
 * Use the same format as rocksdb write ahead log file
 * (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Write-Ahead-Log-File-Format)
 *
 * File format:
 *
 * File is broken down into variable sized records. The format of each record
 * is described below.
 *       +-----+-------------+--+----+----------+------+-- ... ----+
 * File  | r0  |        r1   |P | r2 |    r3    |  r4  |           |
 *       +-----+-------------+--+----+----------+------+-- ... ----+
 *       <--- kBlockSize ------>|<-- kBlockSize ------>|
 *  rn = variable size records
 *  P = Padding
 *
 * Data is written out in kBlockSize chunks. If next record does not fit
 * into the space left, the leftover space will be padded with \0.
 *
 * Legacy record format:
 *
 * +--------------+-----------+-----------+--- ... ---+
 * |CheckSum (4B) | Size (2B) | Type (1B) | Payload   |
 * +--------------+-----------+-----------+--- ... ---+
 *
 * CheckSum = 32bit hash computed over the record type and payload using checksum algo
 * Size = Length of the payload data
 * Type = Type of record
 *        (kZeroType, kFullType, kFirstType, kLastType, kMiddleType )
 *        The type is used to group a bunch of records together to represent
 *        blocks that are larger than kBlockSize
 * Payload = Byte stream as long as specified by the payload size
 *
 * Recyclable record format:
 *
 * +--------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+--- ... ---+
 * |CheckSum (4B) | Size (2B) | Type (1B) | Log number (4B)| Payload   |
 * +--------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+--- ... ---+
 *
 * Same as above, with the addition of
 * Log number = 32bit log file number, so that we can distinguish between
 * records written by the most recent log writer vs a previous one.
