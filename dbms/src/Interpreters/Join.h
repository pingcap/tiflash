/** Data structure for implementation of JOIN.
  * It is just a hash table: keys -> rows of joined ("right") table.
  * Additionally, CROSS JOIN is supported: instead of hash table, it use just set of blocks without keys.
  *
  * JOIN-s could be of nine types: ANY/ALL Ã— LEFT/INNER/RIGHT/FULL, and also CROSS.
  *
  * If ANY is specified - then select only one row from the "right" table, (first encountered row), even if there was more matching rows.
  * If ALL is specified - usual JOIN, when rows are multiplied by number of matching rows from the "right" table.
  * ANY is more efficient.
  *
  * If INNER is specified - leave only rows that have matching rows from "right" table.
  * If LEFT is specified - in case when there is no matching row in "right" table, fill it with default values instead.
  * If RIGHT is specified - first process as INNER, but track what rows from the right table was joined,
  *  and at the end, add rows from right table that was not joined and substitute default values for columns of left table.
  * If FULL is specified - first process as LEFT, but track what rows from the right table was joined,
  *  and at the end, add rows from right table that was not joined and substitute default values for columns of left table.
  *
  * Thus, LEFT and RIGHT JOINs are not symmetric in terms of implementation.
  *
  * All JOINs (except CROSS) are done by equality condition on keys (equijoin).
  * Non-equality and other conditions are not supported.
  *
  * Implementation:
  *
  * 1. Build hash table in memory from "right" table.
  * This hash table is in form of keys -> row in case of ANY or keys -> [rows...] in case of ALL.
  * This is done in insertFromBlock method.
  *
  * 2. Process "left" table and join corresponding rows from "right" table by lookups in the map.
  * This is done in joinBlock methods.
  *
  * In case of ANY LEFT JOIN - form new columns with found values or default values.
  * This is the most simple. Number of rows in left table does not change.
  *
  * In case of ANY INNER JOIN - form new columns with found values,
  *  and also build a filter - in what rows nothing was found.
  * Then filter columns of "left" table.
  *
  * In case of ALL ... JOIN - form new columns with all found rows,
  *  and also fill 'offsets' array, describing how many times we need to replicate values of "left" table.
  * Then replicate columns of "left" table.
  *
  * How Nullable keys are processed:
  *
  * NULLs never join to anything, even to each other.
  * During building of map, we just skip keys with NULL value of any component.
  * During joining, we simply treat rows with any NULLs in key as non joined.
  *
  * Default values for outer joins (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL):
  *
  * Behaviour is controlled by 'join_use_nulls' settings.
  * If it is false, we substitute (global) default value for the data type, for non-joined rows
  *  (zero, empty string, etc. and NULL for Nullable data types).
  * If it is true, we always generate Nullable column and substitute NULLs for non-joined rows,
  *  as in standard SQL.
