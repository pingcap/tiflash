# This library is to override performance-critical routines for aarch64 targets.
# The implementations are imported from official ARM repo.
# To reduce dispatching cost, indirect function technique is utilized. Therefore,
# this library should only be enabled with ELF targets.

# Considerations:
# - By Jun, 2022, most enterprise OSs (CentOS 7, CentOS Stream 8 and RHEL 8) still
#   use relatively old glibc on ARM64, where ASIMD, MTE, DC ZVA and SVE are not
#   fully utilized. However, it is becoming increasingly common to use ARM64 instances
#   in cloud-native situations.
# - `optimized-routines` repo is actively maintained by ARM officials. Therefore,
#   the qualities can be ensured while using it also enables us to keep sync with latest
#   acceleration techniques.
