/// @todo: notice that currently we use plain SIMD without OOP abstraction:
///     this gives several issues:
///     - there may be similar code paragraph for each vectorization extension
///     - this forbids passing SIMD type to template argument since GCC will give
///       off warnings on discard attributes
///     - some binary operations are ugly
///     For future improvement, one should wrap SIMD types into structs/classes and
///     https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html also gives a good example
///     to reduce some burden of type-casting.
