# - Try to find metrohash headers and libraries.
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(metrohash)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  METROHASH_ROOT_DIR Set this variable to the root installation of
#                    metrohash if the module has problems finding
#                    the proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  METROHASH_FOUND             System has metrohash libs/headers
#  METROHASH_LIBRARIES         The metrohash library/libraries
#  METROHASH_INCLUDE_DIR       The location of metrohash headers
